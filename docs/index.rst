The 3dsMax engine
#################

This engine supports 3dsMax version 2017 and up. It favors the use of ``pyxms`` over ``MaxPlus`` and will be the version of the engine that will be maintained in the future.

If you are reading this and are still using the ``tk-3dsmaxplus`` version or the original ``tk-3dsmax`` version that uses the ``Blur Python`` package, you should consider upgrading as we are deprecating both the previous ``tk-3dsmax`` implementation and the ``tk-3dsmaxplus`` implementation.
